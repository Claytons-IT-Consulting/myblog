Writing from my own experience, slow computer speeds can be the result of a virus or malware. I found myself with an extremely slow computer after checking all other areas and not being able to figure out what was causing it. In this situation, you will want to determine first why your desktop is so slow. It can be an easy fix or a more complex problem that calls for replacing something like a hard drive. Whatever the case may be, don't suffer silently with a computer that crawls when you need it most just because you're too afraid to take it in. Instead, invest in getting it checked out by someone who knows what they're doing because in the long run you'll save yourself some money and be able to do whatever it is you need to do on your computer once again quickly!
