If you keep your computer running at optimum speed it will be more than just a time-saver to you. It will also save you some cash. You see, when your computer is running like it should, you are actually saving money because you won't have to buy a new one due to the fact that it has slowed down so much that it is no longer productive for your needs. The last thing we want is to pour money into something that doesn't give us what we need in return.
